## 🔎 Course Overview

I started learning **React** because it’s one of the most popular and powerful tools for building modern websites. The key idea in React is to **build your site using components** — reusable blocks of code that make development modular and efficient.

Initially, I joined the **Coursera course**, but I faced serious issues while setting up a project folder with multiple directories — I got **over 150 errors**. So, I decided to switch to a **YouTube tutorial** by a blogger I had followed in previous semesters. The video course lasted **4.5 hours** and helped me understand things much better. In total, I spent **6–7+ hours** learning.
